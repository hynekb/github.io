**LipPoCalc** application is a practical tool helping to calculate usage of Lithium Polymer (LiPo)
batteries that are used in (RC) model planes, helicopters and cars.

The applications is a simplified calculator with the following functions:

- based on the voltage value of the battery after flight (run), it calculates how much capacity remains in the battery
- based on the capacity added to the battery after the flight, it calculates how much capacity has been used during the flight
- based on the LiPo capacity and the flight time, it calculates average current and average power during the flight
- based on the LiPo capacity and average current during the flight, it estimates flight time
- based on the LiPo capacity, it shows basic parameters for LiPo charging, namely the current,
the power and the time needed to charge the battery
- supported LiPo batteries: 1 to 18 cells (1S to 18S)
- each screen has its info and tips

As said above, the application is a simplified calculator. Do not expect complex math behind
the calculations, the calculations are rather practical approximations to help you to understand
and work with LiPo batteries.
